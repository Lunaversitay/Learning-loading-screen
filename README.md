# Learning-loading-screen
A simple loading screen, mainly to teach people how simple it is to make these.

# What will you learn
Pretty much all the simplisitcs of a loading screen made for Garry's Mod. There are a lot out there being sold for a high price. I decided to just make a little 'how-to'

#How do I learn?
I added in-depth comments in almost every line of code. This is just a simple one so I doubt I'd go into loads of CSS and JS just the functionality cause CSS and HTML are the easiest thing to understand
